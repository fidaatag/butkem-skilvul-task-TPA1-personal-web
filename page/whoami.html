                <h4>Frontend Developer <span>-in progress</span> </h4>
                <p>
                    I have decided to transition into the role of a Frontend Developer. In my previous position, I served as an editor for a WordPress-based website where I was responsible for generating specific content and crafting pages. My experience encompasses proficiency in JavaScript and PHP programming languages, as well as the utilization of WooCommerce, design principles, and photography skills. Furthermore, I possess expertise in SEO strategies and proficiency with tools including Google Analytics, SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Meta ad library.
